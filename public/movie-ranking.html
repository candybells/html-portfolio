            <h2>3. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</h2>
            <p>Firstly, I want to mention the fact that I haven't finished all of the Potter films. 
                But, I am already in love with them and will definitely be rewatching. The moment
                they introduced me to the magical world of wizarding, I started daydreaming about the
                day I would receive my Hogwarts letter. This movie will always have a special place in
                my heart because it was so beautiful and enchanting. I love the ending so much. It was
                so innocent and bright and it made me forget all about my depressions of the world.
                Whenever I feel stressed, watching Harry Potter always makes me feel better.</p>

            <h2>2. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2>
            <p>This is actually the first Harry Potter film I watched,  even though it was the fourth
                in the series. I wanted to watch this because at the time, I was in a Twilight phase and
                I liked the actor that played Edward Cullen in the Twilight series (Robert Pattinson), 
                but keep in mind that I only liked Twilight to hate on it. The movie itself made a lot
                more sense after reading the books. I enjoyed watching the Triwizard Tournament unfold.
                Despite the length of this movie being almost 3 hours long, I was pleasantly surprised to
                find that I was entertained throughout the entire movie.</p>

            <h2>1. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h2>
            <p>Obviously the best. No other movie--Harry Potter movies included--can compare to this
                masterpiece. The plot twists were so good and unexpected and especially at the end,
                there was a huge reveal that changed the entire story. There was so much character
                development, and a lot of things happened. This was a shorter movie, but it was done
                so well. They managed to squeeze in the whole story in only 2 hours. They did change
                one part of the plot, but I think doing that was really smart, because it made it easier
                for the audience to understand what was going on. Prisoner of Azkaban was filled with
                emotions, twists, and drama.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>As you can probably see, I think the Harry Potter movies were all done extremely well.
                It is one of the best, if not the best, book to movie adaptations I have ever seen.
                I do not know how I thought that the Twilight movie franchise could even compete with
                the Harry Potter franchise. All the actors were amazing and it made me want to jump in
                to the movie. I now have Hogwarts robes, $70 wands, and ties, and I am awaiting my
                acceptance letter.</p>
